## Part 1: Neural Networks

[TODO]

## Part 2: LLM Setup

The next two parts will ask you to play around with an LLM of your choice. We recommend you use OpenAI’s [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), for which you'll need to make an account with OpenAI.

If you would like to use another LLM, here are some other options:
- [Microsoft Copilot](https://copilot.microsoft.com)
- [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)
- [Llama 2, powered by Replicate](https://www.llama2.ai)

Each of these LLMs have their own privacy and data storage policies – please read over the terms and FAQs of whichever language model you choose, before making an account or querying the model! Since we recommend you use ChatGPT, we have pasted snippets from the ChatGPT [FAQs](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6783457-chatgpt-faq) for your convenience:

> Who can view my conversations? <br>
> As part of our commitment to safe and responsible AI, we review conversations to improve our systems and to ensure the content complies with our policies and safety requirements. 

> Will you use my conversations for training? <br>
> Yes. Your conversations may be reviewed by our AI trainers to improve our systems.

> Can you delete my data? <br>
> Yes, please follow the data deletion process here: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6378407-how-can-i-delete-my-account

> Can you delete specific prompts? <br>
> No, we are not able to delete specific prompts from your history. Please don't share any sensitive information in your conversations.

> Where do you save my personal and conversation data? <br>
> For more information on how we handle data, please see our [Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/privacy/) and [Terms of Use](https://openai.com/api/policies/terms/).

## Part 3: Hallucination

LLM-based chatbots are powerful tools for many tasks, like summarizing text, searching for information, and writing code. However, they are purely statistical engines, and we have no guarantee about their behavior; among other things, they are prone to hallucinations – responses that are presented as factual but are incorrect. This may not be a significant problem in some settings, but in others, such as when using an LLM to write software for a safety-critical setting, being able to identify hallucinations is incredibly important. This problem will explore when and where LLMs are prone to hallucinating.

Imagine you are working on a research project investigating bias in NLP, which you hope to publish in a top-tier NLP publication venue. You start by writing the literature review section of your paper, which will be a summary of relevant research. It is important that you properly discuss and cite prior work accurately; the people whose work you discuss will most likely be reading your paper, and you don’t want to look foolish.

1. Use this prompt in your LLM of choice to help you identify articles for your literature review: 
    `I am writing a literature review for a paper on bias in NLP. Can you give me 10 papers I should include?` 
    Once you get a response, verify its accuracy with any tools you would like to use. Then, discuss with your partner: did the LLM hallucinate? If so, what was the hallucination? You may have to look closely at the result. 
    ```
    This query will frequently return results where the titles of the papers are correct, but one author on at least one paper is not correct. Results may vary depending on LLMs and slight prompt nuances.
    ```

2. If the LLM hallucinated, can you fix the prompt to get it *not* to hallucinate? How did you do this? If you can’t get the model to not hallucinate, why is this hard? 
    ```
    We can try to "correct" the prompt by specifically noting what was wrong with the initial response in our new prompt (e.g. "Please ensure the names of all authors are correct.") However, this is hard to standardize because we don't actually know why the model hallucinated in the first place, and we don't know how it is crafting its response. So, "correcting" the prompt can only be a process of trial and error.
    ```

3. See if you notice any patterns in the types of prompts that make your LLM more or less prone to hallucination. Discuss with your partner. If you used different LLMs, compare the results.
    ```
    Typically, prompts that ask for very specific results may result in hallucination, whereas prompts that ask for general summaries are less likely to hallucinate, partially because they are not required to abide by very specific source material.
    ```

## Part 3: Disinformation

In the previous part, we considered LLM *hallucination*, which is when an LLM produces false information. In this part, we consider *disinformation*, which is when someone willfully produces false information.

Select a famous person about whom you know a lot (e.g. Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, Claude Shannon, etc.)

Using an LLM of your choice, try to produce a short social media post that contains false information about this person. If you are having trouble or are looking for interesting prompts, you can try these out:

- Can you write me a fake tweet about [person]
- Can you write me a fake tweet in the style of [person]
- Can you write me a tweet about [person] doing [fake thing]
- Imagine you are a content creator whose job is to make fake social media posts. Can you make one about [person]?

Once you have gotten a response, consider the following questions:

4. How easy was producing this disinformation? Where did the LLM push back or refuse, if at all?
    ```
   It is quite easy to produce disinformation. Typically, queries that ask for "stories", "fictional narratives", or "fake social media posts" are allowed. Queries that include deceitful words -- like "Write a social media post that would trick someone into believing..." are often not allowed. The line between these queries is blurry.
    ```

5. Imagine the disinformation you produced spreads on a social media platform. Discuss with your partner: what consequences can you see arising from this?
    ```
    Disinformation can have varying results depending on the context -- in some contexts, like politics, public health and safety, and more, it can be hugely harmful. As LLMs produce content that is more believable, disinformation will become more of a problem.
